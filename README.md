# Bike-Sharing Data Exploration

View the analysis dashboard on Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/DQX7WDWTC?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Overview of the Analysis

Citi Bike data from the month of August 2019 in New York City was analyzed to present to investors for a future bike-sharing business in Des Moines. The information was broken down by user type, starting and ending locations, how long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, how many trips were taken by the hour each day of the week, and a breakdown of what days of the week users might be more likely to check out a bike.

## Results

### Total Number of Trips

![Total Number of Trips](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Number%20of%20Trips.png?raw=true)

In August 2019, a total of 2,344,224 trips were made on Citi Bikes.

### Customer Types

![Customer Type User](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Customer%20Count.png?raw=true)

Breaking down the user types shows there were 443,865 "customers." "Customers" are short-term riders.

![Customer Type Subscriber](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Subscriber%20Count.png?raw=true) 

There were 1,900,359 "subscribers," annual subscribers to Citi Bike.

### Top Starting Locations

![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Starting%20Locations.png?raw=true) 

The top starting locations are in Manhattan, a popular hub in New York City for both commerce and tourism.

![Top Ending Locations](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Ending%20Locations.png) 

The top ending locations are almost identical to the starting locations. We can deduce most of the Citi Bike riders are commuting to tourist and work locations.

### Checkout Times for Users

![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png?raw=true)

As seen above, the majority of riders checkout the bikes for less than an hour, peaking at about ten minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender

![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png?raw=true)

Similar to the checkout times for all users, a breakdown of gender also shows all genders most often used the bikes for around ten minutes.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weejday%20for%20Each%20Hour.png?raw=true)

The most popular times the bikes were used were 6:00am to 9:00am and 4:00pm to 7:00pm Monday through Friday.

### Trips by Gender

![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png?raw=true)

Users of all genders utilized the bikes similarly, between 6:00am to 9:00am and 4:00pm to 7:00pm. These hours happen to be the most common hours workers commute to their jobs. This can be explained by the lack of deviation between genders. We are starting to see a pattern. 

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

![Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/jstearns1988/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png?raw=true)

Both Male and Female subscribers most often rode the Citi Bikes on Thursdays. However, customers of all genders used them most on Saturdays and Sundays.

## Summary

Based on the data analyzed, the majority of the riders are yearly subscribers. These subscribers sway heavily male. All subscribers ride the most during the most common commute hours from Monday-Friday, most popularly Thursday. Customers, on the otherhand, ride the most on weekends. Based on how popular Manhattan is, famous for being a huge tourist and commerce area, we can deduce most of our weekday riders (the majority of riders) are riding the bikes to their jobs. The short commutes would back up this claim. It is to be deduced the users who ride more on the weekend are taking the bikes to the fun attractions offered in the city.

I suggest for our business in Des Moines we focus heavily on similar areas for the most success. Bike stations located closest to homes less than an hour ride from their jobs would be most successful during the week, and near tourest attractions and hotels on the weekends for our liesurely riders. I have also recommended needed maintenance be performed before and after peak commuting hours.

Further analysis should be done to make sure we tailor our approach specifically to Des Moines. I would look into additional data of Des Moines commerce and tourist centers in relation to living areas and public transportation. Comparing a map of Des Moines to New York City could appropriately reflect our funding needs.

I would like to look further into the data for months outside of August. How successful was Citi Bike in the colder months? Are there months with more customers using the bikes than August? There is a lot of information we can gather by looking at all of the above analyzed data for the whole year.

Relating to weather, I would pull weather data for both New York and Des Moines and compare maps to see how similar weather patterns are in both cities. We could set our expectations for the entire year and how much business we could do during times of extreme weather.

I do support the idea of starting a similar endeavor in Des Moines based on how popular Citi Bike is in New York. With more data, we can take a very personalized approach to Des Moines to dazzle investors and future customers.
